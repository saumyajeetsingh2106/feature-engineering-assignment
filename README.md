Assignment – Feature Engineering on IBM HR Analytics Dataset

This project performs feature engineering on the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset. It includes data loading, exploration, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, applying PCA for dimensionality reduction, and using feature selection methods like Variance Threshold and SelectKBest. The goal is to prepare the dataset for machine learning classification.

Impact of Feature Engineering:
Feature engineering improved data quality, reduced noise, removed irrelevant features, and made all variables machine-learning-ready. Scaling brought features to the same range, encoding converted categorical data into numeric form, PCA simplified the dataset, and feature selection improved model efficiency and accuracy.

Tools used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Google Colab.

Ethical Note: Features like Gender and Marital Status can introduce bias, so they should be removed or carefully handled while building models.
